# Assumptions

PostgreSQL is used for transactional data such as guests, properties, bookings, wallet balances, and audit logs.

MongoDB is used for geospatial telemetry data and aggregation-based analytics.

A guest can have at most one CHECKED_IN booking at a time. This is enforced using a partial unique index.

Wallet changes are automatically recorded in the wallet audit table using a PostgreSQL trigger.

The Workflow 2 moving average uses the current row plus the previous six rows, giving a seven-row moving window.

The PostgreSQL seeder generates valid booking records while respecting the partial unique constraint on CHECKED_IN bookings.

The generated data is synthetic and is used for testing database functionality and query performance.

# Performance Proof

The PostgreSQL performance analysis was performed using:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
```

The Workflow 2 query was executed with EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS).

The following partial unique index is created:

```sql
create unique idx_active_stay
on bookings (guest_id)
where status = 'CHECKED_IN';
```

This index ensures that the same guest cannot have more than one active CHECKED_IN booking.

### Query

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)

SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE guest_id = (SELECT guest_id FROM bookings WHERE status = 'CHECKED_IN' LIMIT 1)
AND status = 'CHECKED_IN';
```
